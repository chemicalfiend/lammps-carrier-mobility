# Scripts to get transfer integrals from Gaussian09


Todo:

- [x] Yank monomers and dimers from the big data file in an organised way (Used freud + mbuild for dimers)

- [ ] Script to run a bunch of ZINDO jobs and get the HOMO-1, HOMO, LUMO, LUMO+1 energies for monomers and dimers.

- [ ] Compute the transfer integrals and save in a convenient file

- [ ] Calculate mobility from transfer integrals ??
